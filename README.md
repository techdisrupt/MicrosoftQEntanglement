# Introduction to Quantum Programming with Microsoft

If you ever wondered how to use Microsoft Products in creating quantum algorithms, here is a very minimal example piece of code based on a Microsoft example. However the reason the code exists here in this repo is that there appears to be quite a few issues in the community of getting this code to run and work correctly.

Also you can think of this example, if you cannot be bothered to follow the step by step example and you simply want to get some base code running.

# What you need for this example

1. VScode (Microsoft Visual Studio Code) (This is a fantastic Microsoft Editor)
2. This repo.
3. Some basic knowledge of coding.
4. Some elementary understanding of Quantum Coding or Quantum Information.

# The code in the repo

1. Bell.qs (Base code that creates creates the Qubits, Bell States and performs operations on the Qubits)
2. Driver.qs (The entry point, this is where we run the multiple simulations)
3. Bell.csproj (The XML C# project file)

# Installing and running

1. Get the cold.
2. Open the folder in VScode.
3. Go to the terminal tab, and type: dotnet run
